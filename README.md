# why sass

--Sass is a preprocessor that acts as a layer between your stylesheets and the .css files you serve to the browser.
--Sass helps with the repetition that naturally occurs when writing css, so it helps keep your css dry.
--Being able to declare variables in Sass is one of it's most useful features.
